This repository contains scripts that I (Geoff Benn) have developed to assist with analyzing grades for BIS2C at UC Davis.
The contents are as follows:
1. roster_parse.pl: this script converts the detailed, but unwieldy, roster provided the registrar into a form that we can use
as a master grade sheet (MGS). The MGS is also the starting point for most later analysis.
2. "BIS2C_grade_stats.R" is a script designed to produce a series of pdfs with different visualizations of BIS2C exam results.
This script also provides a basic demographic breakdown of the course.
